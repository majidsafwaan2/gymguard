## üîß Running the App

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
# or
npx expo start

# Run on device
# - Scan QR code with Expo Go app
# - Or press 'a' for Android, 'i' for iOS
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Features Not Yet Implemented:
1. **MediaPipe Pose Detection** - Camera analysis works, but no real-time pose scoring
2. **Form Score Graph** - Would be empty without MediaPipe scores
3. **Real-time notifications** - Use refresh to see updates

### Workarounds:
- For testing without actual pose detection, form scores can be manually added to Firebase
- Community posts use the existing Firebase structure from HomeScreen

## üìä Firebase Collections Structure

```
users/
  - userType: 'patient' | 'doctor'
  - doctorId: (for patients)
  - doctorStatus: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected'
  - patients: [] (for doctors)

patientRequests/
  - patientId
  - doctorId
  - status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected'

workoutAssignments/
  - doctorId
  - patientId
  - exercises: [{exerciseId, comment}]
  - assignedAt

painLogs/
  - userId
  - painLevel
  - location
  - painType
  - notes
  - date

injuryPictures/
  - patientId
  - doctorId
  - imageUrl
  - uploadedAt

posts/
  - userId
  - content
  - type
  - visibility: 'public' | 'private'
  - visibleTo: [userId]
```

## üé® App Theme

- **Primary Color**: #00d4ff (Cyan)
- **Background**: #1a1a1a (Dark)
- **Cards**: #2d2d2d
- **Text**: White/Light gray

## üìù Notes for Testing

1. **Email**: Can use any valid email format for testing (doesn't need to be real)
2. **Images**: Required for injury timeline - test with any photos
3. **Refresh**: Pull down on lists to refresh data
4. **Navigation**: Back buttons work throughout
5. **Permissions**: App will request camera/gallery access when uploading photos

## üöÄ Next Steps (Not in Current Build)

1. Integrate actual MediaPipe for pose detection
2. Implement form scoring algorithm
3. Create form score graphs
4. Add real-time notifications
5. Enhance community features
