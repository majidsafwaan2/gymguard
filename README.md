- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Movement analysis and form correction
- **Evidence-based Exercise Science**: Research-backed injury prevention

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. Real-time Pose Tracking
- 33 3D body landmarks detection
- Joint angle analysis
- Movement pattern recognition
- Support for: squats, deadlifts, bench presses, lunges, push-ups

### 2. Intelligent Feedback System
- Immediate form correction alerts
- Visual overlays on live video
- Audio cues for engagement
- Educational explanations for corrections

### 3. Personalized Training
- Age-appropriate workout programs
- Dynamic warm-up routines
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Rest and recovery recommendations

### 4. Safety Features
- Overtraining detection
- Injury risk assessment
- Parent/coach dashboards
- Privacy-compliant data handling

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Flutter)
- Cross-platform mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Real-time camera integration
- AR overlays and visual feedback
- Responsive UI with modern design

### AI/ML Engine
- MediaPipe pose estimation
