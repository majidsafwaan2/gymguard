## [00:15-00:40] PROBLEM & SOLUTION (Saketh)
**[Switch to slides]**

**SAKETH:** Over 8.6 million sports injuries occur annually in the United States. The average physical therapy session costs $125, and patients often struggle with accessibility and consistent monitoring. Traditional PT requires frequent clinic visits, creating barriers for student athletes.

**[Show slide with statistics]**

**SAKETH:** That's why we created GymGuard—an AI-powered platform that brings physical therapy directly to patients through their phones. Our app combines real-time form analysis, secure doctor-patient connectivity, and blockchain-protected medical records to revolutionize physical therapy accessibility.

## [00:40-01:00] LOGIN SYSTEM (Saketh)
**[Show app - Login/Signup screen]**

**SAKETH:** GymGuard features a dual-user system. Patients can sign up and request a specific doctor during registration, creating a direct connection pathway. Doctors sign up with their medical license information and can accept patient requests through an integrated inbox system.

**[Navigate through signup screens showing patient and doctor options]**

**SAKETH:** This creates a seamless connection between healthcare providers and their patients, enabling remote monitoring and care.

## [01:00-01:35] DOCTOR-PATIENT CONNECTIVITY & BLOCKCHAIN (Safwaan)
**[Show doctor dashboard accepting patient request]**

**SAFWAAN:** Once connected, doctors can assign personalized workout plans based on their patients' injuries. But here's what makes GymGuard truly innovative: all medical records are secured using blockchain technology.

**[Show blockchain records view in app]**

**SAFWAAN:** Every workout score, form analysis, and injury risk assessment is encrypted with AES-256 encryption and stored with a cryptographic hash on the Ethereum blockchain network. This ensures patient data is tamper-proof and privacy-protected.

**[Switch to blockchain flowchart slide]**

**SAFWAAN:** Here's how it works: When a patient completes a workout, our AI analyzes the form, encrypts the data, and generates a unique blockchain hash. Doctors access records through private key authentication, and all data integrity is verified before display. This creates an immutable, secure medical record system.

## [01:35-02:15] FORM TRACKER & POSE DETECTION (Kavin)
**[Switch to app - workout tracking screen]**

**KAVIN:** The core of GymGuard is our AI form tracking system. Using advanced pose detection technology, we track joint angles in real-time during exercises.

**[Show camera recording screen during workout]**

**KAVIN:** As patients perform assigned exercises, our system analyzes 17 key body points, calculating joint angles and comparing them to ideal form standards. The AI detects critical issues like improper stance width, inadequate depth, and spinal alignment—all factors that could lead to injury.

**[Show analysis screen with scores and feedback]**

**KAVIN:** After each set, patients receive detailed scores with specific, actionable feedback. For example, if someone's squat stance is too narrow, the app provides exact instructions: "Move your feet to shoulder-width distance to reduce knee strain." The system also flags potential injury risks, which are immediately sent to the assigned doctor.

## [02:15-02:40] ADDITIONAL FEATURES (Kavin)
**[Navigate through app features]**

**KAVIN:** Beyond form tracking, GymGuard includes an AI chatbot with specialized physical therapy knowledge, providing instant answers to exercise questions. The community feature allows patients to share progress and connect with others on similar recovery journeys. Patients can also track their pain levels over time, creating a comprehensive health monitoring system.

## [02:40-03:00] FUTURE GOALS & IMPACT (Safwaan)
**[Show slides with social proof]**

**SAFWAAN:** We've already begun building our network with a TikTok social media presence and outreach emails to local physical therapy clinics. Our goal is to partner with healthcare providers to expand access to quality physical therapy, especially for student athletes.

**[Show email examples/partnership outreach]**

**SAFWAAN:** Future improvements will include real-time voice feedback during exercises, advanced biomechanical analysis, and integration with wearable devices. By combining cutting-edge AI with secure blockchain technology, GymGuard addresses the accessibility crisis in physical therapy.
